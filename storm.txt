Twenty ships with Norsemen braves
Riding the northern wind

--storm first commit

They left their shores at early dawn
As a red sun was rising in the east

--storm secound commit

The warming sun returns again
And melts away the snow
The sea is freed from icy chains
Winter is letting go

--storm final commit"
